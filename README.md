Wax [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Zayyy01/wax.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Zayyy01/wax)
===

Wax grew out of my frustration with Linq-to-SQL's inability to
handle `InvocationExpression`s, so its main purpose is to allow
common expressions to be saved and re-used instead of repeated
verbatim each time. Wax also contains a few other functions that
I found useful when working with expressions.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq.Expressions;
using ExpressionKit.Unwrap;

static class Example
{
  static Expression<Func<int, int>> Square = x => x * x;

  static Expression<Func<int, int>> SquSquare = Wax.Unwrap<int, int>(
    x => Square.Expand(Square.Expand(x)));

  static Expression<Func<int, int>> Cube = Wax.Unwrap<int, int>(
    x => SquSquare.Expand(x) / x);

  static Expression<Func<int, int>> Foo = Wax.Unwrap<int, int>(
    x => Cube.Expand(x + 1) * Square.Expand(x - 1));

  static void Main()
  {
    var expressions = new[]
    {
      Square,
      SquSquare,
      Cube,
      Foo
    };

    foreach (var expression in expressions)
      Console.WriteLine(expression);
  }
}
```

```sh
x => (x * x)
x => ((x * x) * (x * x))
x => (((x * x) * (x * x)) / x)
x => (((((x + 1) * (x + 1)) * ((x + 1) * (x + 1))) / (x + 1)) * ((x - 1) * (x - 1)))
```

Installation
============

To install Wax, run

```
Install-Package Wax
```

in your NuGet package manager console, or download the source and compile with

```sh
# Assuming Mono's C# compiler
mcs -o+ -t:library -out:Wax.dll *.cs
```

Then, in your code,

```csharp
using ExpressionKit.Unwrap;
```

The Functions
=============

Unwrap
------

This is the heart of Wax.
It's used to unwrap other expressions into their definitions for you,
so that Linq-to-SQL (or perhaps other frameworks that expect simple
expressions) can digest them.

There are two variations of `Unwrap`: one for functions receiving a
single argument, and another for functions receiving two arguments.
In practice, I haven't needed more than this, but I may extend these
to the full length offered by `Func<T...>` in the future.

Expressions are marked for unwrapping using `Expand`, which also
has two variants.

Example:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Linq.Expressions;
using ExpressionKit.Unwrap;

static class MyProgram
{
  static Expression<Func<MyModel, IQueryable<MyProperty>>>
    ModelProperties = /* some complex selection */;
    
  static void Main()
  {
    var red = MyContext.MyModels
      .Where(Wax.Unwrap<MyModel, bool>(m => ModelProperties
        .Expand(m)
        .Any(p => p.Color == Colors.Red)));
  }
}
```

Of course, having to explicitly state the type parameters
for `Unwrap` every time can be irritating, and it is
impossible when one of the type parameters refers to an anonymous type.
Which is why Wax also provides...

UnwrappedWhere
--------------

This function is just Linq's `Where` combined with `Unwrap`
to give you the convenience of type inference.
Using `UnwrappedWhere`, our above example becomes:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Linq.Expressions;
using ExpressionKit.Unwrap;

static class MyProgram
{
  static Expression<Func<MyModel, IQueryable<MyProperty>>>
    ModelProperties = /* some complex selection */;
    
  static void Main()
  {
    var red = MyContext.MyModels
      .UnwrappedWhere(m => ModelProperties
        .Expand(m)
        .Any(p => p.Color == Colors.Red)));
  }
}
```

UnwrappedSelect
---------------

This function is similar to `UnwrappedWhere`.
You can probably guess what it does.

Or, And, Inverse
----------------

These three functions provide basic boolean logic for working with expressions.
Their functionality doesn't extend far beyond what's offerred by `Expression`,
but they are provided as extension methods, which I find easier to read.

Any, All
--------

These two functions are just shorthand for combining lists of expressions with
`Or` or `And`, respectively.

Expand
------

This function doesn't do much by itself; it's only used to flag
which expressions to `Unwrap`. When actually evaluated, it will
throw an `InvalidOperationException`.
